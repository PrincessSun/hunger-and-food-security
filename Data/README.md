Learning Objectives 

1.	Abstract

The purpose of our chapter’s data work has been to understand the landscape of data related to food security. First, our purpose is to learn the relationship among raw data, an indicator, and a composite index.  Understanding these will help us recognize all the steps from data collection to data visualization, and help us experience the difficulties of managing the data. Second, our purpose is to connect concepts and theories with empirical evidence.  It is challenging to identify relationships among different indicators and to test theories related to food security. Third, our purpose is to effectively visualize datasets for comparison among countries and indicators. 

Our data module efforts will be to illustrate how concepts in food security are operationalized and translated into data and indicators. As we mentioned explicitly, there are four dimensions to measure food security, however, the concept of food security still lacks conceptual clarity in development theory and practice. For example, the sustainability factor is lacking but important,  when it comes to long-term environmental impact that is caused by and results in food insecurity. 

Finally, it is a myriad to define and measure food security, because it is linked to multiple indicators, across different age groups, genders, and household sizes. In fact, there is no universally agreed upon index or rankings that points to the right decision of food aid. This data module builds on this empirical work by asking what data is available that indicates whether food is secured, how indicators are being chosen and combined into a composite index. 


Example One: Prevalence of Undernourishment
In this section, we will explore four datasets:
●	Number of People Undernourished (defined by caloric intake below minimum energy,  requirements), 
●	One composite index Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). 
●	Dietary Energy Consumption, 
●	Dietary Energy Supply. 

The PoU index, measuring level of undernourishment, is based on a probability distribution of three parameters: the average dietary energy consumed by a hypothetical average individual; the variability of usual consumption; and a threshold of minimum dietary energy requirement to be in good health, also known as Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER). The dataset is of the years 2017 through 2019. 


Example Two: Global Hunger Index 
In this section, we will explore the Global Hunger Index (GHI) that helps estimate the number of children suffering from severe wasting, wasting, overweight, stunting, and underweight. The dataset measuring these five indicators is saved on GitHub (https://github.com/PrincessSun/hunger-and-food-security/tree/main/Data/Example_2_Global_Hunger_Index) and Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HFIWaZugN4DyPEOwL-XOCvsA4S9t6vkA. The GHI is additional to the PoU index measuring food deficit in calories, it includes the measures of nutrition in children’s diet. The GHI measures hunger at regional, national, and international levels. 

Here are the definitions of each: 
●	Severe wasting: Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus three standard deviations from median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 
●	Wasting: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards.
●	Overweight: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are above two standard deviations from median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 
●	Stunting: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median height-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 
●	Underweight: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median weight-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards.
