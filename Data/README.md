Example One: Prevalence of Undernourishment

In this section, we will explore four datasets:

●	Number of People Undernourished (defined by caloric intake below minimum energy,  requirements), 

●	One composite index Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). 

●	Dietary Energy Consumption, 

●	Dietary Energy Supply. 


The PoU index, measuring level of undernourishment, is based on a probability distribution of three parameters: the average dietary energy consumed by a hypothetical average individual; the variability of usual consumption; and a threshold of minimum dietary energy requirement to be in good health, also known as Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER). The dataset is of the years 2017 through 2019. 


Example Two: Global Hunger Index 

In this section, we will explore the Global Hunger Index (GHI) that helps estimate the number of children suffering from severe wasting, wasting, overweight, stunting, and underweight. The GHI is additional to the PoU index measuring food deficit in calories, it includes the measures of nutrition in children’s diet. The GHI measures hunger at regional, national, and international levels. 

Here are the definitions of each: 

●	Severe wasting: Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus three standard deviations from median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 

●	Wasting: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards.

●	Overweight: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are above two standard deviations from median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 

●	Stunting: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median height-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 

●	Underweight: Moderate and severe--Percentage of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median weight-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards.
