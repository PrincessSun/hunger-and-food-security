## hunger-and-food-security


# Abstract: 

The purpose of our chapter’s data work has been to understand the landscape of data related to food security. First, our purpose is to learn the relationship among raw data, an indicator, and a composite index.  Understanding these will help us recognize all the steps from data collection to data visualization, and help us experience the difficulties of managing the data. Second, our purpose is to connect concepts and theories with empirical evidence.  It is challenging to identify relationships among different indicators and to test theories related to food security. Third, our purpose is to effectively visualize datasets for comparison among countries and indicators. 

Our data module efforts will be to illustrate how concepts in food security are operationalized and translated into data and indicators. As we mentioned explicitly, there are four dimensions to measure food security, however, the concept of food security still lacks conceptual clarity in development theory and practice. For example, the sustainability factor is lacking but important,  when it comes to long-term environmental impact that is caused by and results in food insecurity. 

Finally, it is a myriad to define and measure food security, because it is linked to multiple indicators, across different age groups, genders, and household sizes. In fact, there is no universally agreed upon index or rankings that points to the right decision of food aid. This data module builds on this empirical work by asking what data is available that indicates whether food is secured, how indicators are being chosen and combined into a composite index. 


# Data Exercise: 

The purpose of our data exercise is three-folds. First, our purpose is to visually understand the benefit and limitation behind indicators and composite indices measuring food security. Second, our purpose is to understand how the indicators corresponding to a concept could be biased unconsciously or consciously.  There are four dimensions of global food security measures: availability, access, utilization, and stability. Through these exercises, we want students to understand the indicators that people or entities use to measure any one of the dimensions that could reflect their aspect of viewing these concepts. Third, this exercise helps students understand another dimension of food security “sustainability”, which is often disregarded in the conventional discussion of food security. 

Our first exercise uses the PoU index as an example. The students examine the data sources and answer questions like: What factors are considered in the PoU to evaluate food security? And what factors are lacking in the PoU, but are important to consider? The students will use Excel Spreadsheet to create visualization and compare food security indicators in aspects of different countries. In our second exercise, the students investigate multiple data sources and design their composite index that is best suited for their country rankings and benefits. Besides, the student will design a mathematical model that can reasonably calculate the score of countries. There is no right or wrong answer here, but some equations may be more reasonable.  

The learning objectives of this exercise are: 

1.	Data collection and management: 

a.	Understand the relationship between raw data, indicators that compose an index, and the composite index.

b.	Understand how to collect data for new indicators that you aim to include in an index,  and how different indices are suitable for different use. 

2.	Politics of index:

a.	Explore the questions of how different sources measure the same concept differently, how different indices lead to different results of food insecurity. 

b.	Understand the issues of data manipulation and data deprivation, and how that influences policy making. 

c.	Understand the mathematical model and equation building for the index. 


# Exploring Food Security Indicators: 

FAO’s Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) (2021) estimates how much food is the proportion (percentage) of the population that lacks access to sufficient food consumption and thus struggles with reaching the minimum dietary energy level (kilo/calories). The PoU has played a leading role in measuring global nutritional security. 

Undernourishment is related to but different from undernutrition and malnutrition. While undernourishment is defined as the condition of insufficient food intake, the latter refers to the outcome of nutritional status (FAO n.d.). Although undernourishment applies to the health conditions of individuals, the PoU can only look at a population or groups. The ideal data sources should come from individual dietary intake (daily food consumption) surveys, along with the heights and weights of the survey responders. But this kind of survey is often rare due to the cost and time. Another data source the PoU can include is from household surveys on food consumption or food expenditures. Data collection through household surveys, however, seldom happens as the PoU’s household survey guidelines are often challenging to achieve (see Box 5.3 for the PoU’s guidelines). Besides household surveys, the PoU uses the data from the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects, which estimates the demographic structure of the national population by sex and age, and the FAO Food Balance Sheets, which estimates the national availability of food annually. These data are often collected or managed by the National Statistical Agencies or Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture in each country.

The limitation is that this indicator does not allow us to identify which individuals are undernourished as the available data are all at the national level (FAO n.d.). Critics argue that the PoU should be computed based on a comparison between individual food consumption and needs, but this method is infeasible considering the cost of collecting surveys and lack of data available globally.

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) assesses each country’s progress in achieving SDGs Target 2 by capturing three hunger and food insecurity dimensions (von Grebmer, et al. 2017). These consist of insufficient food availability, child mortality, and child undernutrition, and these are based on four indicators: undernourishment, child mortality, child wasting, and child stunting. Datasets used for these indicators are from FAO’s PoU, the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), and the joint data (2020) of the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), WHO, and World Bank. In most cases, data collection methods were either surveys or census (see Table 5.3). Based on these indicators, each country, except high-income countries, is scored and ranked (high score meaning the country is experiencing food and nutrition insecurity by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Welthungerhilfe, and Concern Worldwide (von Grebmer, et al. 2017). 

Compared to the PoU, the GHI has many advantages in measuring hunger from different dimensions. The aspect of poor nutrition, in particular, was well reflected in the GHI as caloric and nutrition deficiencies (e.g., dietary energy, protein, or micronutrients) (Global Hunger Index n.d.). The included indicators of child wasting and stunting have also allowed the GHI to report both acute and chronic undernutrition. However, collecting all data for the GHI indicators has been challenging due to violent conflict or political unrest (Global Hunger Index n.d.). To complement missing data, the GHI has either utilized the PoU’s datasets or categorized some of the fragile and conflict-affected countries as “alarming” even if those countries in reality could be “extremely alarming (Global Hunger Index n.d.).”

FAO’s Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) evaluates the level of people’s access to adequate food by directly asking each household or individual about their food-insecure experience. These questions solely accept yes/no responses but capture indistinct characteristics like “aptitude/intelligence, personality, and a broad range of social, psychological and health-related conditions (FAO 2008).” The data sources are from national samples of the adults (aged 15 or older) in more than 140 countries and the Gallup World Poll (GWP), an annual survey containing more than 90% of the world’s adult population (FAO 2017). While the FIES, population-level estimates, makes the findings comparable between countries, cultures, and sub-populations, it may be hard for non-specialists to reproduce the estimates and analyze them (INDDEX 2018).

FAO’s Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures (2021) measures government spending in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sector policies and programs (e.g., soil improvement, irrigation, animal health management, afforestation). The AOI is a currency-free index and calculates the ratio of two shares: Agricultural Share of Government Expenditure divided by Agriculture Share of GDP (UNSD 2021).
